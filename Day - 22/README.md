How This Works

- The user selects a shape: Circle (C), Triangle (T), Square (S), or Rectangle (R).
- Based on the selected shape:
- If Circle or Square, the user enters one value (radius or side length).
- If Rectangle or Triangle, the user enters two values (length & width or base & height).
- The program calculates and displays the area of the selected shape.
