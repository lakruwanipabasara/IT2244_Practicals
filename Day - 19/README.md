# Private Messaging System with System V Message Queues

## Overview

This program demonstrates a private messaging system implemented using System V message queues, ideal for server-side environments where privacy and isolation are essential.

## How It Works

- The parent process collects user input (name, registration number, and age).
 
- The message queue transmits the data to the child process.
  
- The child process reads the data and displays the received values.
